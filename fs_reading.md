**Course Description: ENG 1002 READING**

The UNH – KFSC Intensive English Program Reading Module is a 15-hour/week, 4-week course that specifically aims to develop the students’ reading abilities. Students may skip this module if they receive a comprehension score of 60% or better on the Focal Skills reading assessment. During the Reading Module students focus the majority of their time developing their reading skill in English. This includes both the expansion of their English vocabulary understanding of grammatical structure and the development of reading speed and fluency. Students engage in both extensive and intensive reading activities. Extensive reading is individual silent reading for pleasure done in class with teacher support. The UNH – KFSC English Program has a large collection of graded reading material, both fiction and non-fiction, so that students can always find something interesting for them to read at their current reading level. Intensive reading activities involve group reading with the teacher of contemporary newspaper and magazine articles selected by the students based on their own interests. This gives students the opportunity to clarify difficult passages, acquire advanced vocabulary and discuss any unfamiliar grammatical structures and needed in the context of their reading. Students in this module will have an hour each day for semi-independent study in the classroom as described in the Listening module description above. Prerequisite: A comprehension score of 70% on the UNH-KSFC Intensive English Program Listening test.
