# Introduction

The University of New Haven's Academic Bridge program is designed to ensure that non-native speakers of English succeed in their academic studies at the university and in programs it manages abroad. 

Our program follows the **Focal Skills Approach** and differs from other conventional approaches to ESL in two important ways: 
1. We do **not** give equal emphasis to all "four skills" (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) at every point in the curriculum, and 
2. We make exclusive use of authentic materials.

The **Focal Skills Approach** is described in more detail in the following pages. 

In addition to Focal Skills, the curriculum follows an outcomes based design known as **Constructive Alignment**, described by Biggs and Tang (2011) in their book, *Teaching for Quality Learning at University*[](http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Learning-University-Research-Education/dp/0335242758), (4th Edition). Following this design, assessment tasks and teaching and learning activities are explicitly aligned with intended learning outcomes. 

**Constructive alignment** is also described in more detail in the following pages.
