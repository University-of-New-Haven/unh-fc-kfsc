#University of New Haven - KFSC ESL 

##Program Framework ILOs

The following is a comprehensive list of **Intended learning outcomes** (ILOs) for the King Fahd Security College ESL Program Framework. We recognize that teaching and learning activities may also result in outcomes that are not intended but also beneficial to students and to the program. These outcomes typically emerge through the assessment tasks and may be documented at that time.



### 1.0 Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)



**Intended Learning Outcomes** focus on what students are expected to achieve by the end of the course of study. ILOs exist at institutional, program, and course levels. ILOs identify what students should be able to perform after teaching that could not be performed previously. 

_Intended Learning Outcomes_ guide the development of _Teaching and Learning Activities_ (TLA) and _Assessment Tasks_ (AT) and align with them. The following lists of ILOs describe core elements of the UNH KFSC Induction Year Curriculum and may apply to one or more courses included in that program.

_Writing is a powerful tool for participating in academic, professional and civic discourse. People use writing to understand, to learn, to create, to express, and more. Writers need opportunities to explore diverse strategies for finding questions, developing ideas, managing information, and composing various types of texts.

Mathematics involves the practical use of reasoning skills to solve problems on a daily basis. It also serves as a means of communication through the use of appropriate mathematical terminology._

Understanding the discoveries of science and methods by which those discoveries are made also gives us perspectives into human history because advances in science and technology are at the heart of change. Understanding the interactions that take place among physical systems, living systems and technology will help build an appreciation for and development of problem solving skills, critical thinking skills, and social consciousness._
