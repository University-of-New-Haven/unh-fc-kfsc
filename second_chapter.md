# The Focal Skills Approach

The UNH ESL program follows the innovative, effective, and non-traditional [Focal Skills Approach](http://www.focalskills.info/) to second language acquisition. The Focal Skills method was developed 25 years ago and is used by many universities around the world to prepare students for university-level study in English. Focal Skills has been [shown to work more quickly than traditional methods](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:TdoRQZuYm7QJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1).

##Focal Skills Approach Core Features
### Progressive Functional Skill Integration

All students enrolled in the UNH Academic Bridge program are given an initial assessment of English language ability in order to place them in one of four learning modules. In each of these modules, students dedicate most of their time each day to the development of a particular language skill: listening,  reading, or writing in that order, with a fourth module, dedicated to special topics related to each student's personal career focus.
* **4-Week Learning Modules**: Learning modules run for four weeks.  At the end of each learning block, students may choose to take the assessment for that particular language skill. *Based on their score in this assessment*, students either move to the next learning module  or repeat the same learning module for more practice and development of that particular language skill. 
* Students **remain in a given learning module** (listening, speaking, reading, writing, or advanced) **for as long as they need** in order to achieve the target proficiency for that skill. There is an opportunity for promotion to the next level every four weeks. 
* The **time required to complete each module varies** from person to person and may take from 1 to 4 months depending on the individual and the module. This approach ensures that students are able to build their English language ability based on a solid foundation of previously acquired skills. Students may also skip a module or modules *if their assessment score indicates that additional focus on that language skill is not necessary*.[1]

### Low Affective Filter

_Affective Filter_ is a term that refers to the complex of negative emotional and motivational factors that may interfere with the a person's language learning. Such factors include: anxiety, self-consciousness, boredom, annoyance, alienation, and so forth.  In FOCAL SKILLS programs, we maintain low affective filters in the following ways:

* We do **not** test students on the material they are working with.  This eliminates a major source of anxiety. **The only testing in the program is for placement purposes**; whatever anxiety this generates is associated with the infrequent placement procedure, not with the daily classroom environment.
* We do **not** require students to perform when they are not ready and willing to do so. **Speaking is always voluntary** and always welcome; hence, it is genuine speaking, in contrast to the embarrassed, strained output that passes for speaking in some methods. We never make our students feel awkward or self-conscious by putting them on the spot.
* We use **authentic materials** — feature movies, newspapers and magazines, popular fiction, etc. — rather than ESL textbooks and the like. Boredom is less likely with these materials, since they are the kinds of things normal people enjoy in real life.
* We do **not** use exercises, drills, or any kind of artificial task that has no ostensible or sensible purpose other than language practice. Instead, we maintain a flow of ordinary, meaningful language about people, places, things, ideas, stories, and so on. Such activities do not become annoying; they are universally accepted as normal, basic modes of human interaction.
* Teachers function as **partners and mentors** (positive roles) but not as testers and judges (negative roles). All testing and placement is done at the program level, not by the individual teachers. This helps prevent feelings of alienation and hostility toward teachers.*
* **Frequent placement** testing enables us to keep students in groups that reflect their current needs and abilities. Since all of the students in a class have similar skill profiles, they function well as a community. This helps maintain positive attitudes and good will among the class members. [2]
