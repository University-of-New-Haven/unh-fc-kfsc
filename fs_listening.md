# FS Sample Listening Module
             
##Course Description

The UNH – KFSC Intensive English Listening Module is a 15-hour/week, 4-week course that specifically aims to develop the students’ listening abilities. 

* This module may be skipped by any student receiving a comprehension score of 60% or higher on the Focal Skills listening assessment.


During the Listening Module, students will spend 3 classroom hours each day engaged in activities geared towards the development of their ability to understand normal spoken English. A variety of classroom techniques are used in this module. 

During the last classroom hour each day, students engage in semi-independent study of their choosing. This may include, reading, watching lectures on the internet, listening to books on tape, practicing writing, reviewing vocabulary and grammar with computer software, etc. 

This semi-independent study is done with active teacher support. Students repeat the listening module, if necessary, until they achieve a passing score of 60% or higher on the Focal skills listening assessment.  Prerequisite: admission to the UNH – KFSC Intensive English Program.
