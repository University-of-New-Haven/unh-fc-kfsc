# CEFR Alignment

##The Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR)

The Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) is a language-independent benchmarking tool for second language learning developed by the Council of Europe and supported by Cambridge ESOL. The CEFR is intended for use as a self-assessment tool and is described in terms of CAN DO statements. The implication here is that "I can do" and it is in the student's own voice. As such, it describes learning outcomes, not objectives. Since the Focal Skills Approach is a learning centered approach, and since Constructive Alignment is an outcomes based framework, the CEFR is an excellent tool to use to align each of the FC Modules to a specific skill or competency level, as expressed by the CEFR.

###CEFR Levels
The CEFR includes six levels which begin with absolute beginner and end at near-native speaker. Each of these levels is broad enough to subdivide into further, sub-levels. Such divisions differ from institution to institution. The six CEFR levels are as follows

| CEFR Level | Skill Description |
| -- | -- |
| A1 | Absolute beginner |
| A2 | Beginner |
| B1 | Lower Intermediate |
| B2 | Intermediate |
| C1 | Advanced |
| C2 | Near Native |

A majority of students who score in the range of 4.5 to 5.5 IELTS would place themselves at the B1/B2 boundary on the CEFR.

### Alignment with Focal Skills

The Focal Skills Approach follows a progressive sequence of skill acquisition. It does not describe levels for each skill, rather each skill is a level. Using the CEFR, the four Focal Skill Module could be described as follows:

| CEFR | FC Module | Skill Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| A2 | Listening | Beginner |
| B1 | Reading | Lower Intermediate |
| B2 | Writing | Upper Intermediate |
| B2/C1 | Advanced | Advanced |

Alignment with the CEFR helps to ensure that instruction in each module is at an appropriate level of difficulty, that it is neither too easy, nor too difficult for students. This alignment is achieved by asking students at the beginning and end each module to self-assess using a short CEFR survey tool composed of CAN DO statements. We then correlate student responses to the CEFR survey tool with their Focal Skills placement test scores. 

This alignment process helps to identify CEFR CAN DO descriptors that are appropriate to the level. These descriptors then inform the selection of Intended learning outcomes (ILOs), and the design of teaching and learning activities (TLAs) and assessment tasks (ATs). 

###Course and Program Alignment
Alignment is a dynamic and iterative process that unfolds over time to improve the accuracy of placement, the design of teaching and learning activities, and the choice of assessment tasks. At the end of each module, primary stakeholders meet to discuss and revise intended learning outcomes, teaching and learning activities and assessment tasks. Participants may include instructors from target and adjacent modules, UNH Project Management Team members, KFSC administrators, and volunteer student representatives.

Alignment within a module can be observed when intended learning outcomes for that module are directly demonstrated by assessment tasks and when both of these can be directly related to teaching and learning activities.

Alignment within the program can be observed when a majority of students who successfully achieve 60% of the intended learning objectives for a module are able to pass the placement test for the subsequent module.

Alignment between modules can be demonstrated by the existence of a reasonable number of overlapping outcomes among adjacent modules. As a result, the program as a whole exhibits a rising continuum of competency as descried in the CEFR.

###Module Focus

As stated elsewhere in this document, the Focus of each module determines how time will be spent in that module. Students who are in the Reading Module, for instance, will spend most of their time in teaching and learning activities designed to improve their reading skills. 

In the Focal Skills Approach, the Advanced Module is often regarded as optional. Students who have completed the Writing Module may reasonably expect to score in the range of 4.5 to 5.5 IELTS.
