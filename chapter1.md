# ESL at the University of New Haven
The ESL Program at the University of New Haven is an elective program offered to prospective UNH students who have not achieved the minimum standardized test scores required for direct entry to academic programs. Students may present results from several standardized tests of English as a Second or Foreign language, including TOEFL and  IELTS.

Non native English speakers who need to improve their English language skills before joining academic programs may opt for the UNH ESL program or enroll in another English teaching center. Students who successfully complete the UNH ESL program are admitted to academic programs at UNH and do not need to take TOEFL or IELTS. 

The ESL Program at UNH is housed at the main university campus at West Haven, Connecticut. For more information about the home campus program, please see <provide program url>.
